# A-secure-SDN-infrastructure

My thesis on security implementations in an SDN infrastructure, with full analysis on all the subjects related to it.
The report and presentation will guide you through the basics of SDN, with deep and precise descriptions, while a few experiments I conducted will show you practical examples of said technology.

In this thesis, you will find the following subjects and analysis:

In Chapter 1 I introduce you to SDN and network security, the main subjects of this thesis.

In Chapter 2 I analyze more in-depth the history and structure of SDN.

In Chapter 3 I showcase OpenFlow, they protocol that makes most controllers function, from sending data to switches to creating and maintaining flow lists.

In Chapter 4 I get into more detail about Mininet, the software that helped me emulate my SDN infrastructure, and a variety of open-source controllers available to anyone.

In Chapter 5 I analyze into detail the software structure of legacy networks, security in legacy networks with a focus in IDS/IPS, and security in every part of an SDN infrastructure.
 
In Chapter 6 I showcase the idea behind the experiments I conducted, the tools I used and a rough guide of how I installed and used them properly.

In Chapter 7 I analyze the results of my experiments, and how each attack and security tool affects the SDN infrastructure I have set up, while reviewing data from the controller and the virtual network.
